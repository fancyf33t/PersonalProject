I want to make the dice animate and change to give me a single number between 1-6. 
After I am able to get that done, I will repeat the process. Let's start with using Math functions


Refer here:
https://javascript-tutor.net/jSample/jsp_anidice2.html#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20we%20will%20create%20an%20animated,syntax%20is%20as%20follows%3A%20myVariable%3DsetInterval%28myfunction%2C%20time%20interval%29%20

10/30 I am not entirely sure how i am going to deal with the character sheets outside of just using arrays. let's play around...
this is an example of how to base an encounter on

var idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * nflChampions.length);
var message; //this simply initializes the variable message

if (nflChampions[idx].length === 1) {
    message = `Hello, darkness my old friend. It is me. The ${nflChampions[idx][0]}...`;
} else if (nflChampions[idx].length === 3) {
    console.log(`You might be a champion ${nflChampions[idx][0]}, but you are also charged with the following: ${nflChampions[idx][2]}`)
} else {
    message = `CONGLATURATIONS, ${nflChampions[idx][0]}!!! You have ${nflChampions[idx][1]} championship titles!! Good job!!`;
}

10/31 how to i add more complexity to this idea? this is going to get complicated real quick...

sample of the code that i used for the quick fight system. this nesting loop situation is going to require some real work

if (fight > monster[0][1]) {
    fight_result = 'health test has passed';
} else if (fight > monster[1][1]) {
    fight_result = 'will test has passed';
} else {
    fight_result = 'ouch'
}
console.log(fight_result)

10/31 next i need to make the random dice roll test with my character sheet roll because those numbers on the character sheet indicate how many 'die' get used, not a hard number to test (example: culver has will of 3 which means 3 separate die rolls to get either a 5 or a 6)

I am very damn close to figuring this out. Maybe I will use DOM to push only the list items themelves
for (const key in this.assets) {
            const asset = this.assets[key]
            const assetList = document.createElement('ul');
            assetList.className = "nav asset-list justify-content-around"
            assetList.innerHTML = `
            <li class="list-item" id="assetCard">${asset.name}</li>
            `

            if (storeCount < 3) {
                storeRow.append(assetList)
            } else {
                console.log('this doesn\'t work')
            }
            storeCount++
        }

Apply the following changes to your current code
show(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        if(e.target.id === 'menuButton') {
            this.menu.style.display = 'block'; //this already makes more sense to me

        } else {

            this.home.style.display = 'block';
        }
